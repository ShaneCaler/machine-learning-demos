# Unity Machine Learning Agents Demonstrations
To test the capabilities of Unity's ML-Agents framework, I've created several mini-games where agents are taught to play using reinforcement learning, or more specifically, a technique known as Proximal Policy Optimization, implemented in Google's Tensorflow library.

# Scenes:
## - [Flappy Bird](Flappy-README.md)

## - [Snake](Snake-README.md)
### Dependencies:
- Unity ML-Agents 0.7.0
- Python 3.6.4
